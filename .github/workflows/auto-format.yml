# This workflow auto formats code changes in pull requests. It does so
# by checking if any of the touched projects are not formatted correctly,
# and if so creates a new pull request that applies the correct formatting.
#
# It is the responsibility of the person who opened the original pull
# request to verify if they want to apply formatting changes.
