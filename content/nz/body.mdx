_This is an incomplete summary (previously published on Exposure) of the impression I collected on my trip Hawaii - Fiji - New Zealand._

### Aukland

Auckland mainly served as a base to organize the the next part of the New Zealand trip and (finally) being able to boulder again. The 
reminder of my time was spent by exploring small farmer markets (french market, 2nd picture), the harbour area, food trucks and open 
air movies (kudos for the tip) at Silo Park and walking through a sheer uncountable number of small streets in many suburbans to test 
"short black" shots (espresso).

I guess my most memorable impression was a never before experienced mixture of large parks (with short walks) and gardens sprinkled 
around the vast city.

It was peaceful to occasionally rest on a bench or on the grass and just marvel, read and think for a while, allowing my legs a deserved 
rest. The green (and occasional red, orange, violet flowers) colors complemented the lightly desaturated white and blue painted houses 
(commonly found throughout the city) neatly.

### Waiheke island

On a sunny day, I spontaneously decided to spend one day on Waiheke Island. It is just a short ferry from ride from the Auckland ferry 
terminal. Once arrived you can either rent a car, bike, kayak or walk around in the soft forest hills and vineyards.
