# Why Kyrgyzstan?

I was going through a really fucking difficult time in my life and needed to get the fuck away from home.

Die to corona there were few choices where to go. I’m not a wealthy person, so the ticket had to be cheap. Plus the country had to be open to tourists. Kyrgyzstan ticked both checks.

I don’t mind driving a car, so I rented one for the whole duration. Though if you don’t fancy driving yourself you can also hire a driver for relatively cheap. You can also get pretty much everywhere tourists need to go by public busses or taxis.

I had a few places I wanted to visit, and then whatever I would have time for in between. Going to such a country with no experience traveling through Central Asia meant that I had to be open to changes. That proved true just two days after I arrived. Lesson learned.

Driving in Kyrgyzstan is an adventure for someone from Westen Europe. What appears on google maps as a regular intercity road often turns out as a gravel road.  With potholes. And trucks stopped on the side of the road.

Even if the road is covered with fresh Chinese asphalt, the line markers are considered as decoration. You simply drive wherever you see fit. Mainly to avoid people and livestock wandering across the roads.

Driving during night.
