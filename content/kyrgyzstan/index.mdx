I was going through a really fucking difficult time in my life and needed to get the fuck away from comfort.

Due to corona and other constraints I was limited where I could go. First, I’m not a wealthy person,
so the airplane ticket had to be cheap. Plus the country had to be open to tourists.
Kyrgyzstan ticked both boxes.

I booked the flight and began planning what to do once there.

Better not tell my parents though, lest they worry what might happen to me traveling through an
ex-USSR country.

# Transportation

I don’t mind driving a car, so I rented one for the whole trip. I wanted to be flexible,
stop wherever I wanted, and to drive to places regular busses wouldn’t go. As far away
from civilisation as the road would take me.

<Image
  source={importImage("https://storage.googleapis.com/caurea.org/stories/kyrgyzstan/IMG_1801.jpg")}
/>

And did I go to places, so incredibly
beautiful that I wanted to stay there forever. Literally. I went to places I didn’t want
to leave even though I knew I had to in order to arrive at my planned destination in time.
Every time I sat myself into the car wanting to drive away I got back out again because
I just couldn't imagine myself being in any other place, ever.

Driving in Kyrgyzstan is an adventure on its own. What appears on Google Maps as a regular, paved
intercity road may turn out a gravel road. With potholes so big you could hide a battalion in them.
Perhaps those were purpose-built back in the cold war to be prepared in case the US is going to invade
Kyrgyzstan.

And abandoned trucks on the side of the road. Lots of those.

Some roads are covered with fresh Chinese asphalt. The lane markers are considered decoration though.
You simply drive wherever you see fit. Obstacles to take into consideration when choosing your path:
people, potholes, livestock, snow drifts, police. Livestock in particular – horses, cows, sheep – is
everywhere, wandering around the countryside, roads, and generally wherever they see food. It takes a
certain amount of courage to trust the animals not to suddenly run into the middle of the road.

They are more used to cars than I was to them. _Nothing to see here, move along_.

I highly recommend getting a 4x4 car. Not only because of the gravel roads, but also to avoid
getting stuck somewhere. My rental company included some tools and a shovel with my car, the shovel
proved useful on two occasions. I wouldn’t say I panicked when I discovered that I’m stuck, but a lot
of uncomfortable thoughts started going through my head at that point. The country has a fairly good
and fast cell service (4G), but not deep in the mountains. If you plan on getting stuck somewhere,
I recommend a PLB or a satellite phone.

Winter days are short, and that doesn’t leave much time to drive if you don’t want to drive at night.
And not driving at night is generally a good idea. Cars do have headlamps but turning them on is optional,
or so it would seem. The police certainly don’t care about that, they only care about speed limits.

# Wealth, or lack thereof

The poverty gap is pretty big. On one side you see Lexus cars driving around, on the other side you see people living on less than a dollar a day. A lot of it is due to corruption.

Speaking of corruption, it’s there, but not well distributed. Perhaps the politicians in Bishkek are susceptible to it, but not the police in Karakol. I couldn’t get them to write me an important police report of a car crash, no matter how hard I pressed. Given that everybody was telling me how corrupt the country is, I was surprised about the integrity of the police there. This made me both happy (police has integrity) and sad (no police report for me) at the same time.

# Blending in

While driving around the countryside and smaller towns, I saw a lot of people waiting on the side of the road and flagging down cars. They usually want to go to the next town or be taken however far you can take them in that general direction. Whenever I could I stopped and took them along for the ride. How could I not, seeing a young woman with two children standing there in freezing temperatures, or a young boy sitting on the side of the road wanting to be taken to the playground a bit outside of the town? We didn’t communicate much beyond their hand gesture pointing towards where I should stop. But it felt great being part of the local culture where people help each other out whenever possible.

The first words out of my mouth when I met someone were usually «Я не говорю по русски» (I don't speak Russian). The rest of the conversation was then done through broken english on their side, hand gestures, or with the help of google translate. Most people don’t know english though, only in places which are frequented by tourists. And even there, having had no tourists for a year, some were unsure themselves if they still spoke english, after not using it for such a long time. One guesthouse I called thought I was joking when I called and asked if they spoke english and had a room for the night.

The country speaks two languages: Russian is the official language, while Kyrgyz is the national language. The people appreciate if you learn a few words in Kyrgyz, especially outside of larger cities where people live the more traditional life.

# Places

I had a few places I wanted to visit, and then whatever I would have time for in between. Going to such a country with no experience traveling through Central Asia meant that I had to be open to changes. That proved true just two days after I arrived. 

One of the places I wanted definitely go to was Karakol, and spend a day on the slopes of their ski resort. Being from Switzerland I knew I couldn’t expect the same quality of the infrastructure, but oh boy was I surprised. First the fact that there is no paved road to the ski resort – just a gravel road – was a sign of what was to come. The ski resort hasn’t invested into the ski lifts since they were built. That means I now have a genuine feeling of how skiing was in USSR back in the 70s.

# Climate

The country gets surprisingly little snow during winter. It’s cold for sure – -30 is not uncommon – but there is very little precipitation. And whatever snow falls to the ground is so incredibly powdery that it doesn’t compact well and is blown away in just a few days. What is left is a brown landscape with few patches of white snow few and far apart. Only in the mountains above 3500 you see permanent snow.

A day before I arrived in Jyrgalan the whole region saw heavy snowfall and I was greeted with a beautiful snow-covered landscape.

# No tourists

I felt like the only western tourist in the whole country, I certainly have not seen any other foreigners except a few people from Russia. Whoever I met was happy to see a tourist come back into the country after such a long time. But I was also referred to as crazy for traveling alone through the country, during times of a pandemic. I wasn’t ever concerned about my safety though.

My original plan included going to places where no-one has ever gone to before in winter. Kyrgyzstan has vast swaths of land which are hostile to life during the winter months and few locals dare to go there.

It’s in those places where I felt a presence like never before in my life. There is something really profound in being surrounded by nothing but raw nature for miles in all directions, under clear skies, with everything that you see illuminated by the power of a thousand suns.

Kyrgyzstan is a country where you can go to without any prior plans at all, except having a first night booked in a hostel, and still manage to have a good time. The owners of hostels and guesthouses are happy to organise whatever trip you can imagine for you. Or perhaps I was lucky because there were no tourists and pretty much every guesthouse was empty, and every tour operator idle.

That brings me to the aforementioned change of plans. I had heard of this wonderful place called Song Kul Lake before going to Kyrgyzstan, but hadn’t planned to go there. But when I was offered a multi-day horse trek to go there, I accepted.

Song Kul Lake in winter is a deserted place. The high altitude (3000m) and mountains all around it keep the cold air trapped in. Temperature at night can easily fall to -30, and that’s not including the chill factor due to wind.

The horse trek was not the typical tour anyone else would have experienced during the previous years, or at least it didn’t feel like it. It wasn’t season and nobody was really prepared to take on tourists. It felt more like the horse guide taking me along for a visit to his friends. We stayed at their houses, helped them out tending to their livestock, cooked and ate together and then continued with our trip the next day.

The only request I got from the farmer we were staying with was to lend him 1000 som (ca. 10 CHF) so he can buy a bottle of vodka.

I got a glimpse into the life of those people. They are living a hard life in winter, high up in the mountains, without electricity or connection to the outside world for days at a time, in -30 degree nights, with only a small stove for cooking some food and warming up hot water for tea.

Only after I came back I was told that fishing in Song Kul Lake is illegal. I was staying at an illegal fishermen’s
camp, helped them pull fish from the lake, and we then ate that fish for lunch. On that day, we actually ate their
whole catch of the day. Let that sink in for a moment: they were selfless enough to share their catch with us without
regard to their own profit from the day’s work. And I didn’t even realise what was going on around me at that time.
I don’t envy them, even though they are doing something they clearly know is illegal, there are few alternatives in the
region. High unemployment and no job opportunities push people to do these things.

On the last day before I was flying back to Switzerland I was driving into the mountains, once more in search of a
place far away from civilisation. On my way I spotted a group of children playing on an ice-covered slope, and
spontaneously decided to join them.

That little detour, that change in mind, led to one of the happiest moments during the whole trip. One of those
moments in life which make you rethink your whole existence, if you know what I mean.

That place. That view. The children. And me in the middle of all of that. Even more, I wasn’t just an outside
observer, I played an active part in shaping that moment, together with everyone who was there at the same time.

Children are born same everywhere on earth. Innocent, playful, happy. They have no destination they ought to
arrive at, they just want to be.

They want you to have fun with them together, and don’t care that you don’t speak their language. It’s up to
you to accept that invitation into their little bubble of happiness.

By pure chance I had bags of chocolates in the back of my car. I will never forget the looks on their faces
when I showed them and told them to take as much as they can carry.
