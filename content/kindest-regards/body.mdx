In August 2023 I traveled to the United States to attend a workshop.
I decided to extend my stay and first spend a week with friends around San Francisco, and later travel alone through the Sierra Nevada.

During the first week my friends and I rented a house in Sequoyah, Oakland.
Everything we wanted to reach was only a few hours away by car.

During the day we ventured as far south as Monterey and as far north as Muir Woods.
During the evenings we experimented in the kitchen, baking traditional czech pastries in vegan style.

The second week I was alone.
I rented a campervan and set off towards the north.

My plan was ambitious for the time I had.
America is larger than I expected and I did not manage to visit all the places I wanted.

First stop was in Lassen Volcanic National Park.
The landscape around was still visibly scarred by the 2021 Dixie Fire.
Some areas along the road were lined with charred trees.
In other areas the trees had already been cut down and left a view on gently rolling hills covered only by grasses.

On my way down south I stopped to visit the fire lookout on Sierra Buttes North.

The fire lookout is not manned anymore.
The structure still stands, but it's empty.
Remotely operated cameras have replaced the humans who used to watch the surrounding forests during fire season.

It was end of summer and the next winter season was about to start.
By this time all the snow from the previous season would usually be gone.

Winter season 2021/2022 however has seen exceptionally heavy snowfall.
There was still enough water melting from the snow to keep creeks flowing and plant life in healthy green colors.
I even had to cross a few snow fields on my way to Bishop Pass.

Many trails in the Sierra Nevada were inaccessible throughout most of the spring and summer.
Either because there was still snow blocking the trails, or due to damage caused by avalanches.
Hiking season has therefore shifted back a few months and I got to meet more backpackers on the trail that is usual in September.

I noticed that I will not have enough time to drive all the way to the south to cross the Sierra Nevada into the Central Valley.
The other option to cross the mountain range was through Yosemite National Park.

Big Pine was the southern-most town in Owens Valley that I drove through.
In Big Pine I exited U.S. Route 395 to drive towards the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest and White Montain Peak.

White Mountain Peak is one of the easiest accessible mountains over 14 thousand feet in California.
The trail follows a road all the way to the top.
It's not technically challenging, nor that far to walk.
But it's high enough to notice the decreased oxygen concentration in the air.

I entered Yesomite National Park before dawn and left long after sunset.
It wasn't my first time in Yosemite, but the first time I entered the park from the east.

I left the car at Tenaya Lake and started walking towards Clouds Rest
Half Dome is a more famous peak in Yosemite Valley.
But a permit is required to climb it, and it's more dangerous than most people want to admit.

Clouds Rest on the other hand is far easier to get to.
It's also slightly higher than Half Dome, so you get a nice view onto Half Dome from above.

In the afternoon I relocated to Glacier Point.
A huge crowd gathered there to watch the sunset.
Once the darkness has set in, I jumped into my car and started driving towards San Farncisco.
The next morning I headed to the airport to fly back to Switzerland.
