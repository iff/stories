I originally wanted to go to the Azores. Hiking, camping, maybe even swimming in
the sea. But the weather forecast was showing a storm system crossing the
islands just when I wanted to be there. And so I shifted my focus on Madeira.

<Image size="narrow" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/stories.caurea.org/dreamers-wake/IMG_5457.jpeg" />

Madeira is an island a bit to the south-east of the Azores, of similar origin
(they are both volcanic island groups), with similar weather, and equally many
options for enjoying the nature. Madeira was actually a bit easier to get to as
there are direct flights from Zürich, Switzerland. It wasn’t the cheapest
flight, but I can’t complain as I was booking the flight on a Friday afternoon
and departing the next day at 06:30am.

That gave me about 12 hours to plan what to do, and more importantly what to
pack. Note that the 12 hours were including any sleep if I wanted to get some.
In terms of weight, the camera gear (which I wanted to take with me) and laptop
(which I needed for work) accounted for almost as much as all the camping
equipment I brought along. This is to show how little gear you actually need to
camp in the wilderness.

Madeira is a popular destination for all sorts of young and old people from
other countries who live there, work remotely, or arrived on Madeira to retire.
There is also a large and active digital nomads community.

I found plenty of resources online how to get in touch with them. The «Digital
Nomads Madeira» Slack workspace in particular was especially helpful. Almost
every day there is an activity or event happening around the island. All it
takes is to write a simple «Yes, I’m in!» and you’re up for an adventure.

While looking through the offered activities I saw that someone is organising a
boat ride to the neighbouring island Desertas. 8 people, one boat, a skipper,
barbecue on Desertas, illegal late night party, spend the night there, then back
to Madeira. All for ~130 Euro. The boat was leaving exactly one week after I
arrived on the island. I only briefly hesitated before I announced my interest.

I didn’t even look for accommodation before I set off to Madeira. I knew I’d
spend the first week or so camping. And so the first thing I did when I got
through customs was to get a car, drive to a Decathlon in Funchal to grab some
camping supplies (food, fuel, … stuff I didn't want or couldn't bring on the
plane).

After getting everything I needed I spent the rest of the day in the capital
city of the island, Funchal. I can highly recommend the Monte Palace garden
which can be easily reached via cable car. In the late afternoon I headed
towards the hills above Funchal to look for a suitable campground.

Having your own car for getting around the island is definitely useful. Of
course I opted for the cheapest car, I only needed space for one backpack after
all. The clerk at the car rental office recommended that I get a slightly larger
– more powerful – car. I respectfully declined. Half an hour later, on my way on
the highway from the airport to Funchal I realised why.

The roads on the island are steep. Like really steep. It wasn't uncommon for me
to drive in second gear. Even on highways. The clutch on the poor car was almost
fully worn out.

In a week I managed to drive almost around the whole island, view its diverse
faces, and walk many gorgeous trails.

The more popular trails on the island are well marked and safe to walk. The less
popular trails are less well marked and less safe. If you are not comfortable
walking half a meter from a steep cliff to your side, without any guardrails
to separate you from abyss, then you best avoid those.

I never felt in danger while walking the trails. But I had a few moments where
stepping a few centimetres more to the side could have meant the difference
between me coming home and me ending up as fish food.

Only at the very end of my stay on Madeira I was made aware that people
regularly disappear during walks alone on these trails. To the polish trail
runner who went for a practice run and never came back a few days before I left
the island: rest in peace.

Trails along levadas (irrigation channels or aqueducts) are the easiest to
walk∑, they are essentially level without any steep inclines. They also lead
mostly through forests, which shade you from the scorching sun.

While walking the trails I noticed that trees are constantly shedding leaves. It
is not something I’m used to seeing in mainland Europe, where most trees lose
leaves only in autumn. But it does make sense: the soil is so rich in nutrients
and the weather is constant all around year that everything grows all the time.
Almost as if there were no seasons.

Wild camping is prohibited, but there are official campgrounds strategically
placed across the whole island. They are free and the only requirement is that
you fill out an online form. It’s really not that difficult, takes about five
minutes.

I met a lot of backpackers on the trails, not a single one filled out the form.
I did, dutifully, every single time. Of course I did, I grew up in Switzerland,
and rules are to be followed. It was just a mild inconvenience, after all.

I still don’t speak more than «thank you» in Portuguese. Most people I was
interacting with spoke really good English. And I learned pretty early on to
greet people on trails with «dobrý den» (Czech) or «bonjour» (French). Speaking
Czech quite that often was not something I was expecting when I set to travel to
Madeira, but it felt nice to speak some of my mother tongue again. Some days I
felt I was somewhere in the Czech mountains rather than on Madeira.

Not once did I encounter rain – the classical rain I know from mainland Europe –
but I got wet a few times nonetheless. The particular topology of the island and
the climate around it cause clouds to form and gather around the tall mountains
of the island. If you are at an altitude between about 900-1200 meters above sea
level, you’ll often find yourself in thick fog, and water starts condensing all
around and on you.

The Fanal forest is located at a north-facing slope of the island, at a
particular altitude above sea, that it often finds itself engulfed in thick
clouds. When the sun shines through the dense fog, it makes the landscape around
appear almost like a magical place.

I spent the night there, along with two lovely young ladies who were crossing
the island from east to west on foot. They were from Czechia, unsurprisingly. We
got to chat by a cup of hot tea and some biscuits.

I had met the couple earlier that day on the trail, and apparently I frowned
while walking past them. This provided them entertainment for a good amount of
time, as they were trying to come up with reasons for my unusual facial
expression.

Yes, I know, I'm not the most friendly looking individual. Especially when I'm
thinking about something, which I do a lot, and which I was while walking past
them. But I'm aware of it. And all I can say that I'm working on it, I'm trying
to smile more.

They however couldn't quite grasp the idea that I'm «trying», it sounded foreign
to them. It's hard work for me, and I'm not always succeeding.

Before it got too dark I decided to walk around the forest, trying to capture
the magic moment, with my eyes and heart equally. While standing in the middle
of a small depression I heard a stampede behind me and as I turned around I saw
cattle racing towards me. It took me a second or two to realise what’s going on,
and even longer to recover from the shock. I’m not particularly easy to scare,
but the sound of what seemed an elephant racing towards me gave me the chills.

I was hoping that the clouds will clear up until the morning and I’ll be able to
watch a beautiful sunrise from a nearby hill. Instead I woke up with the tent
soaked. The clouds hadn’t cleared up and the chance to see the sun was nil.

After a week of camping around the island I was dirty and needed to get myself
cleaned up. The shores in and around Funchal offered a wide selection of four-
and five-star hotels. No reservation was required, the hotels were mostly empty
anyways. I got a good deal at one, they even upgraded me to a room with a pool
view. The next morning I left for Desertas.

I went to Madeira to be alone, be away from work, enjoy nature once again. After
walking across the island for a week I felt ready to have two days doing
nothing. Let myself float wherever the boat would take me. I didn’t care about
who else was on the boat, as I had no intention interacting with them.

The first thing I noticed on the boat was that I’m immune to sea sickness. The
perpetual rocking of the boat didn’t affect me at all. On the way back from the
island I even went under the deck to take a nap (something the skipper strongly
advised against).

Going on that trip turned out to be one of the best decisions I did while I was
there. The sea was exceptionally calm and we got to see dolphins. And I got to
meet some lovely and rather interesting people.

After getting back to the main island I still had one corner of the island to
explore: Ponta de São Lourenço. It is the easternmost point of Madeira, located
on a peninsula.

Because I was on Madeira around the summer solstice, the sun was setting and
rising quite far in the north. From where I was standing on the peninsula, the
sun set just behind Santana on the northern coast of the island, and rose just
east of Porto Santo (the neighbouring island to the north-east of Madeira).

Ponta de São Lourenço concluded my exploration of the island. On my way to Ponta
do Sol, where I was to spend the rest of my time on the island, I stopped for a
night at the Parque Ecológico do Funchal. The park seemed closed, and I couldn’t
find any information as to why.

The park is high enough to be above the cloud cover and offered me unobstructed
views to all directions, and there was plenty of open space where I could set up
camp.

Ponta do Sol is not the nicest town on the island, but it has a beach, a hotel
on the cliff with a nice view, and a public coworking space. Though I can highly
recommend the «Purple Fridays» sunset party at the Estalagem hotel. I was
staying at that hotel and didn't have to walk far to reach my bed.

I had one last weekend available to me before I had to fly back to Switzerland,
and I used it to cross another item off of my bucket list: spend the night at
the top of Pico Ruivo, the highest mountain on the island.

Three trails lead up to the top. The one from Achada do Teixeira is the easiest,
it takes less than an hour on a trail with almost no incline. The trail from
Pico do Areeiro is very demanding as it forces you to cover 300 altitude meters
down and then up again. The last trail to the top from Encumeada is not so
steep, but long (~11km one way) and the trail is not that well maintained.

There is one official campground a bit below the peak. But I didn’t want walk
down in the darkness after sunset (and up again before sunrise), so I set my
sleeping bag just below the stone pylon which marks the peak. The pylon gave me
a bit of a protection from the wind. The night was exceptionally warm, but the
strong wind woke me periodically up all throughout the night.

Like a subtle nudge, that I should have a look at the pristine night sky. And
indeed, every time I opened my eyes I would watch the stars for a few minutes,
before falling asleep once again.

More than once I’ve been told that I’m crazy. I’m not quite sure whether it was
the fact that I was traveling alone or the particular activities I was doing.

The three young people who came up to Pico Ruivo in the dark after sunset, just
to take a couple pictures of the night sky and then walk down again were no
exception. But sure, I’m the crazy one for leaning back and taking the time to
look at the night sky all night long and not them for traveling three hours just
for the opportunity to snap a few pictures and then hiking in the pitch black
night back home.

I'm the crazy one.

The reason why I had to fly back to Switzerland still bugs me to no end. All of
2020 we survived on Zoom, Sype, Slack and all the other digital tools. But that
one client demanded that I be physically present at that one meeting in Zurich.

I mean, sure, let me fly 2600 km across the ocean so that we can meet in person,
and two hours later part ways to never see each other again. What an efficient
use of resources.
