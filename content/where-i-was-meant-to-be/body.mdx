I was going through a really fucking difficult time in my life and needed to get
the fuck away from comfort.

Due to corona and other constraints I was limited where I could go. First, I’m
not a wealthy person, so the airplane ticket had to be cheap. Plus the country
had to be open to tourists. Kyrgyzstan ticked both boxes.

I booked the flight and began planning what to do once there.

Better not tell my parents though, lest they worry what might happen to me
traveling through an ex-USSR country. On multiple occasions I was told that I'm
crazy traveling through Kyrgyzstan by myself. But I never felt unsafe, not even
in Bishkek at night.

I don’t mind driving a car, so I rented one for the whole trip. I wanted to be
flexible, stop wherever I wanted, to drive to places regular busses wouldn’t go.
As far away from civilisation as the road would take me.

And I did go to places – places so incredibly beautiful that I wanted to stay
there forever. Places I didn’t want to leave even though the sun was already
setting behind the mountains and I knew I had to get back to town.

Driving in Kyrgyzstan is an adventure on its own. What looks on Google Maps as a
regular, paved highway may in fact be a gravel road. To deal with the many
potholes, you can either drive very slowly around them, or fast enough to fly
straight over them.

Some roads are covered with fresh Chinese asphalt. The lane markers are just
decoration though. You simply drive wherever you see fit. Nobody will be mad at
you for driving on the left side of the road because you're trying to avoid
hitting a cow.

Livestock – horses, cows, sheep – is everywhere, wandering around the
countryside, roads, and wherever they see food. It takes a certain amount of
courage to trust the animals not to suddenly run into the middle of the road
while you speed by them at 90 km/h.

They are more used to cars than I was to them.

I highly recommend getting a 4x4 car. Not only because of the gravel roads, but
also to avoid getting stuck somewhere. My rental company included some tools and
a shovel with my car. The shovel proved useful on two occasions.

The country has a reliable, fast, and cheap cell service (4G), but not deep in
the mountains. If you plan on getting stuck somewhere, better get a PLB or
satellite phone.

Winter days are short, and that doesn’t leave much time to drive if you don’t
want to drive at night. And not driving at night is generally a good idea. Cars
do have headlamps but turning them on is optional, or so it would seem. The
police certainly don’t care about that. They do care about speed limits though.

The poverty gap is pretty big. On one side you see Lexus cars driving around, on
the other side you see people living on less than a dollar a day. A lot of it is
due to corruption.

Speaking of corruption, it’s there, but not well distributed. Perhaps the
politicians in Bishkek are susceptible to it, but not the police in Karakol. I
couldn’t get them to write me an important police report of a car crash, no
matter how hard I pressed. Given that everybody was telling me how corrupt the
country is, I was surprised about the integrity of the police there. This made
me both happy (police has integrity) and sad (no police report for me) at the
same time.

I spent half a day at the police station and that was the end of that episode.
During my time there, I felt strangely relaxed and not all bothered about what
was happening around me. Deep inside me I knew that there was nothing that I
could do, that I could say to advance my situtation. So why bother? Be happy,
smile, and accept.

While driving around the countryside and smaller towns, I often saw people
waiting by the side of the road and flagging down cars. They usually want to go
to the next town or be taken however far you can take them in that general
direction. Whenever I could I stopped and took them along for the ride. How
could I not, seeing a young woman with two children standing there in freezing
temperatures, or a young boy sitting on the side of the road wanting to be taken
to the playground a bit outside of the town?

We didn’t communicate much beyond their hand gesture pointing towards where I
should stop. But it felt great being part of the local culture where people help
each other out whenever possible.

The first words out of my mouth when I met someone were usually «Я не говорю по
русски» (I don't speak Russian). The rest of the conversation was then done
through broken english on their side, hand gestures, or with the help of google
translate. Only few people speak english, fewer still speak it well.

I had a few places I wanted to visit, and then whatever I would have time for in
between. Even before I set off, I had a feeling that my plans wouldn't remain
set in stone. That proved true just two days after I arrived.

One of the places I wanted definitely go to was Karakol, and spend a day on the
slopes of their ski resort. My first surprise was the fact that there is no
paved road to the ski resort – just a gravel road.

The ski resort itself was in ok shape. The ski lifts were running, which was a
good sign. And what more should I expect from a ski resort which hasn't invested
in its infrastructure since it was built? I had a good time, and that is all
that counts.

Also, I now have first-hand experience of how skiing was in USSR back in the
70s. To be honest, it wasn't pleasant and I prefer the swiss style.

The country gets surprisingly little snow during winter. It’s cold for sure –
-30 degrees celsius is not uncommon – but there is very little precipitation.
And whatever snow falls to the ground is so incredibly powdery that it doesn’t
compact well and is blown away in just a few days. What is left is a brown
landscape with few patches of white snow few and far apart. Only in the
mountains above 3500 you see permanent snow.

A day before I arrived in Jyrgalan the whole region saw heavy snowfall and I was
greeted with a beautiful snow-covered landscape. A few days later most of the
snow was gone.

I felt like the only western tourist in the whole country, I certainly have not
seen any other foreigners except a few people from Russia. Whoever I met though
was happy to see a tourist come back into the country after such a long time.
It's been close to a year since people saw foreign visitors.

My original plan included going to places where no-one has ever gone to before
in winter. Kyrgyzstan has vast swaths of land which are hostile to life during
the winter months and few locals dare to go there. Sounds perfect for an
inexperienced traveler, right?

But it was in those places where I felt alive like never before. There is
something really profound in being surrounded by nothing but pure nature for
miles in all directions, under clear skies, with everything that you see
illuminated by the power of a thousand suns.

Kyrgyzstan is a country where you can go to without any prior plans at all,
except having a first night booked in a hostel, and still manage to have a good
time. The owners of hostels and guesthouses are happy to organise whatever trip
you can imagine for you. Or perhaps I was lucky because there were no tourists
and pretty much every guesthouse was empty, and every tour operator happy to
have a customer.

That brings me to the aforementioned change of plans. I had heard of this
wonderful place called Song Kul Lake before going to Kyrgyzstan, but hadn’t
planned to go there. But when I was offered a multi-day horse trek to go there,
I accepted.

<Image blobId="DDsnkgx8svZiSTNWkkdSjJYHn6anuds9mtbUxeKtJvPb" size="default" />

Song Kul Lake in winter is a deserted place. The high altitude (3000m) and
mountains all around it keep the cold air trapped in. Temperature at night can
easily fall to -30, and that’s not including the chill factor due to wind.

But all that doesn't matter the slightest bit.

For when you step out of the yurt at 10 pm to take a last piss before going to
bed, stand there in the middle of wherever you want, because it doesn't matter
where you do the deed, and look up into the sky, see every single star in the
visible universe, see the milky way as clear as a stroke of titanium white
across a black canvas, that very moment you forget that you are exposed to the
elements. You simply stop caring about everything.

The horse trek was not the typical tour anyone else would have experienced
during the previous years, or at least it didn’t feel like it. It wasn’t season
and none of the regular infrastructure was available. It felt more like the
horse guide taking me along for a visit to his friends. We stayed at their
houses, helped them out tending to their livestock, cooked and ate together and
we then continued with our trip the next day.

I got a strange request from one of the nomads we were staying at. He wanted to
borrow 1000 som (ca. 10 USD) so he can buy a bottle of vodka. I didn't hesitate.

<Image blobId="6fg5WGqKfheQgqDKi9PDJ1anmrg1okCzJn1Kpwi8EsyG" size="full" caption="Sunrise over Song Kul" />

I'm grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of those people's
lives, even if for just a day. They are living a hard life, high up in the
mountains, without electricity or connection to the outside world for days at a
time, in -30 degree nights, with only a small stove for cooking some food and
warming up hot water for tea.

Only after I came back I was told that fishing in Song Kul Lake is illegal. I
was staying at an illegal fishermen’s camp, helped them pull fish from the lake,
and we then ate that fish for lunch. Wow.

On that day, we actually ate their whole catch of the day. Every single fish
they pulled out of the lake.

Let that sink in for a moment: they knew they are doing something illegal, yet
they were selfless enough to share their catch with us without regard for their
own profit from the day’s work. And I didn’t even realise what was going on
around me at that time.

Even though they were doing something they clearly know is illegal, there are
few alternatives in the region. High unemployment and no job opportunities push
people to do these things.

On the last day before I was flying back to Switzerland I was driving into the
mountains, once more in search of a place far away from civilisation. On my way
I spotted a group of children playing on an ice-covered slope, and spontaneously
decided to join them.

That little detour, that change in mind, led to one of the happiest moments
during the whole trip. One of those moments in life which make you rethink your
whole existence, if you know what I mean.

That place. That view. The children. And me in the middle of all of that. Even
more, I wasn’t just an outside observer, I played an active part in shaping that
moment, together with everyone who was there at the same time.

Children are born same everywhere on earth. Innocent, playful, happy. They have

They want you to have fun with them together, and don’t care that you don’t
speak their language. It’s up to you to accept that invitation into their little
bubble of happiness.

By pure chance I had bags of chocolates in the back of my car. I will never
forget the looks on their faces when I showed them and told them to take as much
as they can carry.
