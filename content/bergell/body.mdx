Mainly due to Covid-19 we decided to explore the Bergell valley for one week in our summer vacation.
It resembled Ticino to a degree that was a bit confusing - some small differences (mostly the foliage) provided
enough visual cues to tripping up the perception.

Overall it was a very relaxing experience. The camp ground was tidy and spacey making our stay despite 2 days of heavy
rain (and not very picture friendly weather) bearable. Once the rain finally subsided we were free to roam higher up
in the mountains.

Most notably I liked our little adventure up to the Albigna hut. A cosy hike leads along a dam and then up a rocky path
passing the Albigna hut.

We climbed a little bit higher to catch the views of various peeks and glaciers (mostly receding). As the
slopes flattened a sea of stones appeared. Since I brought my climbing shoes I went for a short circuit
bouldering on whatever looked and felt interesting.

On our way back we parked our car on the Maloja pass and followed a very well traveled path along the shores of lake Sils. The weather was picture
perfect and strolling slowly through woods and grassy shores (busy digesting what our eyes greedily gulped down) we made our way to Isola and back.
