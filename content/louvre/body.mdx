Well I was actually looking for a visit to the Louvre.. but I did not expect lots of people queueing in front of paintings to take pictures or pose for a picture with the painting. Eventually we had to flee to a less frequented corner.

Unfortunately something went wrong (transposing the film) and the negatives show artefacts. Below a small selection of frames that were still more or less intact.
