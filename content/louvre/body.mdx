Well I was actually looking forward to visiting the Louvre.. but I did not expect dense crowds of people queueing in front of paintings to take pictures or pose for a picture with the painting. Eventually we had to flee to a less frequented corner.

Unfortunately something pervented the film to 'transport' properly and the negatives show artefacts (scratches and bends). Below a (tiny) selection of salvagable frames that hopefully convey our experience.
