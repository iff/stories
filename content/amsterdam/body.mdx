While visiting my godfather in Amsterdam I decided to work on my reservation (or perfectionism?) of "wasting" analog film material. So one evening I loaded a fresh TMAX400 and cycled out to take pictures of whatever captured my attention (and not return until the film is full).

Below a selection (of mostly smombies) on a regular Thursday evening in Amsterdam.
