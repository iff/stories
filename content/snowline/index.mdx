With the expectations of a sunny (but cold) spring day we started our hike Baeretswil in the direction of Wald passing over Bachtel.
After the first few steps we were greeted with fog and cold winter breeze. Despite the unfortunate change of weather we pushed on. 
Upon arrival on the ridge we stumbled across a beautiful yet somewhat strange mix of colors. 
With the snow line just above the ground wintery whites mixed with lush green and brown hues. This experience continued while the 
vegetation changed providing a multitude of varying color and texture patterns.

I don't know if and when I experienced this somewhat odd mix of colors before.
