# Clip

Clips are short video sequences (not more than roughly 20 seconds long).

The `<Clip>` component does not provide controls to seek within the video, the
user can only start and stop the video (hence the reason why clips should not be
too long).

When the clip is not playing, a **Poster Image** is shown (think of it like the
custom YouTube thumbnail). The image supports a placeholder (like the
[Image](/docs/components/Image) component).

Semantically the `<Clip>` component renders a `<figure>`, with an optional
`<figcaption>`. The video itself is a plain `<video>` element.

The component does not support changing resolutions (quality). While it would be
a nice feature to have, it's not worthwhile to implement for such short videos
(an 18 second video in 720p is about 6 MB).
