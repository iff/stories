# Body

The `Body` component renders the MDX that contains the story content.
The component applies the proper styling for (some of the) standard Markdown elements (such as h1, h2, paragraph, blockquote).
It also supports three custom components inside MDX: Image, Group, and Clip.

## Layout

The component establishes a 5-column CSS grid layout.

The center column is used for regular content (paragraphs).
It has a max-width set such that text remains readable and isn't displayed in too wide lines.

Some of the custom components can chose to be rendered slightly narrower, slightly wider, or stretch all the way to the viewport edges.

## Samples

The following samples are used to demonstrate and test specific content types:

- [Text](./Body/samples/text): headings, paragraphs, block quotes.
- [Image](./Body/samples/image): the image component in all its layout variants.
- [Group](./Body/samples/group): the group component showing in multiple configurations.
