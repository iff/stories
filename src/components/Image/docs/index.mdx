# Image

The `<Image>` component is used to display images inside stories.

## DOM

The DOM tree looks roughly as follows:

```html
<div>
  <figure>
    <img />
  </figure>

  <figcaption />
</div>
```

## Layout

By default the image is displayed in its intrinsic aspect ratio. It's also possible
to make it fill the available space (~ `object-fit: cover`).

<Grid style={{ margin: "20px 0" }}>
  <Exhibit caption="Image in its intrinsic aspect ratio">
    <Sample variant="basic" caption={undefined} />
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit caption="Image fills available space (height: 200px)">
    <div style={{ display: 'grid', height: 200 }}>
      <Sample variant="basic" caption={undefined} layout="fill" />
    </div>
  </Exhibit>
</Grid>

## Placeholder

As long as the image is not loaded yet, a placeholder image (generted by [SQIP]) is shown
in its place. Once the image is loaded, the placeholder image is faded away.

<Grid style={{ margin: "20px 0" }}>
  <Exhibit caption="Placeholder showing while image is loading.">
    <div style={{ display: 'grid', height: 200 }}>
      <Sample variant="placeholder" layout="fill" />
    </div>
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit caption="After image is loaded.">
    <div style={{ display: 'grid', height: 200 }}>
      <Sample variant="basic" caption={undefined} layout="fill" />
    </div>
  </Exhibit>
</Grid>

## Caption

The caption can be either placed below the image (default), or into an overlay which is visible
on hover. The later is used when the image is placed into a `<Group>`.

<Grid style={{ margin: "20px 0" }}>
  <Exhibit caption="Caption below the image">
    <Sample variant="basic" captionPlacement="below" />
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit caption="Caption shown in overlay on hover">
    <Sample variant="basic" captionPlacement="overlay" />
  </Exhibit>
</Grid>
