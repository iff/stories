# Image

The `<Image>` component displays an image.

The layout options are:

 - **full**: all the way to the edge of the viewport
 - **extended**: slighty wider than the text column
 - **regular**: same width as the text column
 - **narrow**: narrower than the text column

The height of the image is always as determined by the image aspect ratio.

## Caption

The caption can be shown either below the image (default), or in an overlay
on hover. The later is used when the image is placed in a `<Group>`.

<Grid style={{ margin: "20px 0" }}>
  <Exhibit caption="Caption below the image">
    <Sample variant="basic" />
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit caption="Caption shown in overlay on hover">
    <Sample variant="basic" captionStyle="overlay" />
  </Exhibit>
</Grid>
