# Image

The `<Image>` component is used to display images inside stories.

It is a block element. The DOM tree looks roughly as follows:

```html
<div>
  <figure>
    <img />
  </figure>

  <figcaption />
</div>
```

The caption is optional. When available it is displayed either below the figure,
or on top of it on hover. See example further below.

By default the image is displayed in its intrinsic aspect ratio. It's also possible
to use `object-fit: cover` so that it stretches and covers the available space.

As long as the image is not loaded yet, a placeholder image (based on [SQIP]) is shown
in its place. Once the image is loaded, the placeholder image is faded away.

The layout options are:

 - **full**: all the way to the edge of the viewport
 - **extended**: slighty wider than the text column
 - **regular**: same width as the text column
 - **narrow**: narrower than the text column

The height of the image is always as determined by the image aspect ratio.

## Caption

The caption can be shown either below the image (default), or in an overlay
on hover. The later is used when the image is placed in a `<Group>`.

<Grid style={{ margin: "20px 0" }}>
  <Exhibit caption="Caption below the image">
    <Sample variant="basic" />
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit caption="Caption shown in overlay on hover">
    <Sample variant="basic" captionStyle="overlay" />
  </Exhibit>
</Grid>
