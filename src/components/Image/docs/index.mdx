# Image

The `<Image>` component displays an image.

The layout options are:

 - **full**: all the way to the edge of the viewport
 - **extended**: slighty wider than the text column
 - **regular**: same width as the text column
 - **narrow**: narrower than the text column

The height of the image is always as determined by the image aspect ratio.

The component allows caption text to be added, which is shown below the image.
